# Plato (Backend)

Plato aims to become the go-to Urbit solution
for fast prototyping, code sharing, showcasing and education.

Planned features:
- Nock/Hoon modes
- Integration with Clay and Ford

Plato does not try to be a full featured editor such as Atom,
but instead is meant as a quick-and-dirty Hoon sandbox.

# Install

Get plato up and running on your urbit in seconds.
Head to http://www.urbitetorbi.org/plato/install
for installation guide. 

# Running locally

Use the `urbit-dev` tool to link the plato Hoon source code 
inside your deck, or manually copy them to appropiate directories.
